  <h1>What is a Commercial Website?</h1>
   <p>
As you may already know, there are various types of websites out there. However, you can generally divide them into two big groups based on their original intention – personal website (for example a portfolio website) and commercial website. The latter is what we’re going to uncover here.

Commercial websites are managed by a business with organizational motives. Function-wise, it’s main purpose is advertising and increasing visitors’ product knowledge. As every commercial website’s goal is to increase sales of a particular business, its content and design must reflect the brand’s image.

Apple’s main website belongs to such a group. As a commercial site, the webpage is meant to educate visitors regarding Apple’s brand and products as well as facilitate the transaction process. The color scheme also revolves around Apple’s logo, clearly indicating that it represents the brand.</p>

 <h1> Security</h1>
 
   <p>All types of websites are bound to have sensitive information that isn’t meant for public consumption. This is particularly true in commercial websites’ case.
   Not only do they store company-sensitive information, but commercial websites also tend to collect and manage visitors’ personal data.<br>
   

Unfortunately, the number of data breaches keeps increasing every year. Ransomware, data theft, phishing – there are tons of security breaches that can compromise your 
business and other people’s privacy. And they could happen to any website, including yours. For this purpose, ensuring a secure web browsing experience must be your top priority.</p>
